# Epigenetic Impact
Epigenetic changes can be thought of as changes that alter expression levels in the genome, but do not alter any DNA. This has implications for proteins that are known to interact with the genome. These are known as transcription factors, and they can raise or lower the rate of transcription. 

Recently, it has been of interest to study different molecules, such as RNA, that interact with DNA to see their downstream epigenetic affects. RNA-genome interactions can have an impact on downstream epigenetic changes. One well studied example of a ncRNA cis-interacting with chromatin to produce epigenetic changes is known as Xist. Xist is a ncRNA produced in female mammals from a locus on the X-chromosome (ChAR-seq paper). Once it has been produced, it covers the X-chromosome it was produced from and silences further transcription. Another example of a RNA cis-interactions causing epigentic affects happens in D.melanogaster. The lncRNAs roX2 and roX1 are involved in a male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, in which they coat the X-chromosomes in males in order to acetylate the histone H4K16 (ChAR-seq paper). The acetylation of chromatin essentially opens it to transcription. Because acetylated euchromatin is open, the interaction of the lncRNA increases transcription.
