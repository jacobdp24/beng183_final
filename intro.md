## 1. Introduction<a name="1"></a>

RNA exists in the cell not only as an intermediary between DNA and the final protein product, but also as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which fulfill biological purposes beyond just DNA transcription. Among these purposes is RNAâ€™s role in RNA-genome interactions, where RNA exists as part of the epigenome [1]. As part of the epigenome, RNA takes part in actions such as gene activation and silencing, on both a local level (via RNA-protein interactions and local DNA interactions), and a global level (where the RNA can modify gene expression levels). These interactions occur both proximally and directly, depending on the distance that the RNA and DNA have between themselves. As a result of the variety of different interactions that RNA and DNA can have, new technologies have emerged to map out connections to the genome. These technologies include MARGI (mapping RNA-genome interactions) and CHAR-seq. Each sequencing technology allows for different information to be learned regarding RNA-genome interactions [1].
